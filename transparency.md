#Â Note on transparency

According to the course discussion at https://class.coursera.org/exdata-013/forum/thread?thread_id=30 a more correct way of doing things is to include a transparent background in the plots, as per the example figures included in the original repo that this was forked from. I have commented in the code where the par command is used to achieve this, however if a white background is required, then this part of the par command just needs to be amended.

Thanks
Tom
